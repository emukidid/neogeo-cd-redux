[NGC]
- Based on NeoCD Redux 0.1.52A.
- Thanks to infact and his efforts and work posted on github. 
- Various code changes to supress "most" compiler warnings
- Minor Audio Rewrite:
   . "Glitchy" Audio introduced due to latest devkitppc/libogc incompatibility
   . removed original audio threading code to fix the issue
- Added Automatic TV mode detection (based on GC IPL version)
- Added Progressive Video display / Component cable auto detect. Supported video types:
   . 480i/480p
   . 576i/576p << need feedback to confirm if any issues with PAL video mode (slowdowns or audio)
- Added Safemode Menu display:
   . Force Menu to display 480i video with Digital Component cable (CRT SDTV compatibility)
   . Hold L TRIGGER during bootup to activate
- SDHC support
- Menu enhancements: New Menu (almost complete rewrite of old code)
- Graphical improvements  < thanks infact & NEOCD - WII
- Now supports both SD and DVD loading
   . Fixed MP3 playback < thanks NEOCD - WII
   . also added/modified ability to correctly play mp3 audio from SD and DVD
   ... old code only had compatibility for one or the other (hence, reason for previous multiple version distributions)
   . BIOS must be located on chosen media
- BIOS search locations:
   . /neocd/bios/NeoCD.bin
   . /bios/NeoCD.bin
   . allowed original bios location to keep backwards compatibility with my old DVDs
- Title FileBrowser now defaults to display contents from /neocd/roms/  << (yes i know it uses CDs not ROMs)
   . example: /neocd/roms/metalslug
   . broswer will default to / for DVD or if /neocd/roms is not located on SD card
- MEM Card no longer required for "Save File":
   . Save File will now default to SD card /neocd/save.bin << thanks infact
   . option added in menu to use MEM CARD
- Minor controller changes: 
   . L Trigger will return to main menu
   . R Trigger will save file
